## Hi there!

This is my main repository. Here I merged some projects that were spread around my other accounts on GitHub and GitLab, to make life easier. Even if my main Python production is hosted inside companies' private repos, you can have an overview of my job. 

  * Python / Django
  * Devops / Infrastructure 
  * Systems architecture / Test driven development
