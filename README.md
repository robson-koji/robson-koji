## Hi there

I merged some projects that were spread around my other accounts on GitHub and GitLab to make life easier. However my main Python production is hosted in companies private repos, but you can have an overview of my job. 

  * Python / Django
  * Search engine Solr / Elasticsearch
  * Data visualization d3js / Matplotlib  
  * Devops / Infrastructure 
  * Systems architecture / Test driven development
  * Problem solver / Solution oriented  
  * Split large complex goals into manageable pieces
