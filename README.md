## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I merged some projects that were spread around my other accounts on GitHub and GitLab to make life easier. However my main Python production is hosted in companies private repos, but you can have an overview of my job. 

Some technologies I like:

  * Python / Django
  * Search engine Solr/Elasticsearch
  * Data visualization d3js / Matplotlib  
  * Test driven development
  * Systems architecture
  * Machine learning
